## Basic Rules of the Game
- Board & Pieces
  - Played on an 8x8 board.
  - Each player starts with 16 pieces, placed on the entire second and third rows from their side.
  -  Unlike some other draughts variants, all squares are used, not just the dark ones.
- Movement
   - Men (normal pieces) move forward or sideways, one square at a time.
   - They cannot move diagonally or backward.
   - Kings (promoted pieces) move any number of squares horizontally or vertically (like a rook in chess).
 
- Capturing
  - Captures are mandatory.
  - Capturing is done by jumping over an opponent's piece in a straight line (forward, backward, or sideways)
  - Multiple captures (in one move) are allowed and required if possible.
  - A piece is captured and removed only after the full capturing sequence is completed.
- Promotion to King
  -  A man becomes a king when it reaches the last row on the opponentâ€™s side.
  - Kings are very powerful and move like a rook (orthogonally, any distance).
- Winning
   -  The game ends when one player has no legal moves left or loses all their pieces.
   -  A draw is possible if no player can force a win.
